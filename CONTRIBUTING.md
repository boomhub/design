## Feedback 

General feedback on what you think would work and what wouldn't. Things to add, things to think about. Everyone's invited to participate in this discussion.

## Sponsorhip

If you are working at a corporation which uses open source software, consider the idea of 
contributing to the implementaion of BoomHub. We need both financial and infrastructure support.

The funding will be used to pay salaries for developers working on the implementation of the BoomHub prototype. In exchange, your company will get a place in history for being one of the founders
of the world's first free software funding platform.

## Technical lead

While I would love to be able to lead the technical side of things, I believe I will not be the best bet for the success of the project if I were to assume this role. 
Although I'm an experienced programmer, my experience in managing large scale projects, involving teams of people is very limited. 

As such I believe that the project has a much better chance of success if it were led by a person with the experience and energy to bring it to completion.

So basically BoomHub needs a person passionate about the concept and possessing the broad set of technical skills required to implement it. 
That means experience in building systems that scale to tens of millions of accounts and billions of transactions, payments systems integration and github integration.

We're also talking about building the dependency tree of the world's open source software, which is a graph with tens of millions of nodes and billions of edges, which poses interesting scaling challenges.

## Developers

BoomHub needs people with experience in areas such as backend and databases, front end and design, 
payments systems integration, 3rd party services integration (github, bitbucket).

## Business administration/management/legal/corporate relations

The project needs people who will assume the tasks of contacting and getting corporate support and/or involvement in the project, building relationships with other OSS foundations and getting them on board, setting up the foundation and finding sponsorhip.

#Technical overview

Technically, BoomHub is an interesting and rather ambitious undertaking. There are 20+ million repositories on GitHub alone and some 10+ million developers. If we include other services, those numbers are even greater. And given the recursive nature of the transfers, great amounts of transaction data would be generated if the service is successful.

Since Github is the ultimate source of truth about repositories and users, BoomHub would generate a large amount of traffic with GitHub (and other such services).
Detecting dependencies automatically is a challenging task as well, since we're talking about a lot of different programming langauges and environments with different sets of configuration files and dependency management systems.
